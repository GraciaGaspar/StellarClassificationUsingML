# StellarClassificationUsingML
The aim of this project was to classify stars into the spectral classes of the Morgan Keenan (MK) classification system using features like temperature, luminosity, radius, iron abundance, age, B-V color index, and absolute magnitude of the star. 
Data from the Extended Hipparcos catalogue (XHIP) was used to train a random forest machine learning model on the features, and an accuracy score of 88.61% was obtained.
A web application was built where users can enter such features to obtain the stellar classification and the confidence score of classification.
